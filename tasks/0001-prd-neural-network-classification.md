# Product Requirements Document: Neural Network Classification Learning Project

## Introduction/Overview

This project implements a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer as an educational exercise to demonstrate neural network fundamentals. The project will generate synthetic data that benefits from non-linear classification and compare the performance of logistic regression (linear) against a neural network (non-linear) to showcase the advantages of neural networks for complex pattern recognition.

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive learning tool that demonstrates neural network concepts including forward/backward propagation, activation functions, and loss computation through hands-on implementation.

## Goals

1. **Educational Understanding:** Provide clear implementation of neural network fundamentals for learning purposes
2. **Performance Comparison:** Demonstrate superior performance of neural networks over logistic regression on non-linearly separable data
3. **Code Quality:** Deliver well-tested, modular code with comprehensive documentation
4. **Visual Learning:** Create clear visualizations showing data distribution, decision boundaries, and training progress
5. **Practical Implementation:** Show real-world application of neural network concepts

## User Stories

- **As a student learning neural networks**, I want to see a complete implementation from scratch so that I can understand how neural networks work internally
- **As a learner**, I want to compare logistic regression vs neural network performance so that I can see the benefits of non-linear classification
- **As a student**, I want to visualize the decision boundaries so that I can understand how the models separate different classes
- **As a learner**, I want to see training progress through loss curves so that I can understand the learning process
- **As a student**, I want to test individual components so that I can verify my understanding of each part

## Functional Requirements

1. **Data Generation Module:** Generate 400 synthetic training samples with 2D coordinates (x1, x2) and binary labels (Yes/No) in a non-linearly separable pattern
2. **Logistic Regression Implementation:** Implement logistic regression as a baseline linear classifier
3. **Neural Network Architecture:** Implement a 2-8-1 neural network (2 inputs, 8 hidden neurons, 1 output) with tanh activation in hidden layer
4. **Activation Functions:** Implement tanh activation function for hidden layer and sigmoid for output layer
5. **Loss Function:** Implement cross-entropy loss function for binary classification
6. **Forward Propagation:** Implement forward pass through the neural network
7. **Backward Propagation:** Implement backpropagation algorithm for gradient computation
8. **Training Loop:** Create training procedure with both fixed epochs and early stopping options
9. **Testing Framework:** Implement basic functionality tests for each module
10. **Visualization System:** Create plots for data distribution, decision boundaries, and training curves
11. **Performance Metrics:** Calculate and display accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
12. **Comparison Analysis:** Generate comprehensive comparison between logistic regression and neural network performance

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Deep Networks:** This project focuses on single hidden layer only
2. **Advanced Optimizers:** Will use basic gradient descent (Adam/SGD not required)
3. **Real Dataset:** Only synthetic data generation, no real-world datasets
4. **Production Deployment:** This is purely for educational purposes
5. **Advanced Regularization:** No dropout, batch normalization, or L1/L2 regularization
6. **Multiple Output Classes:** Binary classification only (2 classes)

## Design Considerations

- **Code Structure:** Modular design with separate classes for LogisticRegression, NeuralNetwork, and utility functions
- **Visualization:** Use matplotlib for clear, educational plots with proper labeling
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings and comments for educational value
- **Error Handling:** Basic input validation and clear error messages
- **Reproducibility:** Fixed random seeds for consistent results

## Technical Considerations

- **Dependencies:** numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn (for comparison), pytest (for testing)
- **Python Version:** Compatible with Python 3.7+
- **Memory Efficiency:** Handle 400 samples efficiently without memory issues
- **Numerical Stability:** Implement stable versions of activation functions and loss computation
- **Gradient Checking:** Optional gradient checking for debugging backpropagation

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy Improvement:** Neural network achieves >15% higher accuracy than logistic regression
2. **Code Quality:** All modules pass basic functionality tests
3. **Educational Value:** Clear visualizations demonstrate learning concepts effectively
4. **Performance:** Training completes in reasonable time (< 30 seconds for 1000 epochs)
5. **Documentation:** Code is self-documenting with clear comments and docstrings

## Open Questions

1. Should we include gradient checking functionality for debugging?
2. What specific non-linear data pattern would be most educational (XOR, circles, spirals)?
3. Should we implement mini-batch training or stick to full-batch gradient descent?
4. What level of mathematical detail should be included in comments?
